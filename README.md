# Low level brightness filter 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the low level implementation of a multi-threaded brightness filter in Java. The filter is destined for 24 bit BMP, RGB images. The GUI is purely functional and was developed using JavaFX. This allows for selecting the brightness level, storing the resulting file, viewing the progress etc.
